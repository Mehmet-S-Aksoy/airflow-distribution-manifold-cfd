# airflow-distribution-manifold-cfd
This project simulates internal airflow distribution inside a 3-outlet manifold. The goal is to achieve uniform flow across all outlets under a total inlet flow of 3 L/min. The study was performed using ANSYS Fluent and ANSYS Mechanical meshing tools, focusing on pressure drop, streamline visualization, and outlet velocity profiles.

# airflow-distribution-manifold-cfd-analysis

This project simulates internal airflow distribution inside a 3-outlet manifold. The goal is to achieve uniform flow across all outlets under a total inlet flow of 3 L/min. The study was performed using ANSYS Fluent and ANSYS Mechanical meshing tools, focusing on pressure drop, streamline visualization, and outlet velocity profiles.

## Problem Definition

- Air enters the manifold at a flow rate of **3 L/min**.
- Goal: Achieve **uniform outlet flow** (Â±10% variation allowed).
- Outlet gauge pressure is set to **0 Pa** at all three exits.
- Evaluate if current manifold design meets the uniformity requirement.

## Key Results

- Inlet velocity and pressure gradient properly resolved.
- Outlet flow rates varied between X%â€“Y% across branches.
- Observed backflow and turbulence in certain branches due to geometry.

## Purpose

This project was completed to practice flow field distribution analysis inside a manifold, simulating real-world intake/exhaust systems.

I'm a **Mechanical Engineering Master's student** focused on **CFD and FEA**. This project supports my portfolio as I pursue a role in:
- HVAC or automotive flow systems
- Turbomachinery
- Thermal-fluid systems
